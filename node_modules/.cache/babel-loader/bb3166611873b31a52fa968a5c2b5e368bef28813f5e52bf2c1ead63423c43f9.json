Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year. Group size is limited to six.</p></li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\t<p>Note: The Brooks Camp Developed Area (BCDA) means all park areas within a 1.5 mile radius from the Brooks Falls Platform.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bear Orientation:</strong> All persons visiting the BCDA must receive an NPS-approved Bear Orientation.

(There are three fire rings established in the Brooks Campground near the picnic shelters.) All campfires must be closely attended and fully extinguished when finished.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Within the BCDA, washing dishes or cooking utensils at locations other than the water spigot near the food cache in the Brooks Campground is prohibited.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Property:</strong> Leaving property, other than motorboats and planes, unattended for any length of time within the BCDA is prohibited, except at the Brooks Lodge Porch, Brooks Campground, or designated equipment caches as posted at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year. Group size is limited to six.</p></li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\t<p>Note: The Brooks Camp Developed Area (BCDA) means all park areas within a 1.5 mile radius from the Brooks Falls Platform.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bear Orientation:</strong> All persons visiting the BCDA must receive an NPS-approved Bear Orientation.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year. Group size is limited to six.</p></li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\t<p>Note: The Brooks Camp Developed Area (BCDA) means all park areas within a 1.5 mile radius from the Brooks Falls Platform.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bear Orientation:</strong> All persons visiting the BCDA must receive an NPS-approved Bear Orientation.

Checkout time is 12:00 p.m.).</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Campfires:</strong> Lighting or maintaining a fire is prohibited except in established receptacles in the BCDA. (There are three fire rings established in the Brooks Campground near the picnic shelters.) All campfires must be closely attended and fully extinguished when finished.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Within the BCDA, washing dishes or cooking utensils at locations other than the water spigot near the food cache in the Brooks Campground is prohibited.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Property:</strong> Leaving property, other than motorboats and planes, unattended for any length of time within the BCDA is prohibited, except at the Brooks Lodge Porch, Brooks Campground, or designated equipment caches as posted at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center. This regulation applies to gear left in open boats and gear left hanging on airplanes. (Store all gear you are not willing/able to keep in your immediate control in the gear caches.)</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Pets:</strong> Possessing a pet, including assistance animals, in the BCDA is prohibited.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Picnicking and Possession of Food Items:</strong> Within the BCDA, picnicking is only allowed at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center Picnic Area, Brooks Campground, and Brooks Lake Picnic Area.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.

Help maintain a safe experience for you, your fellow campers, and those who will visit in the future by following the regulations below. Your appropriate actions and behavior are the key to maintaining this unique experience.</p>\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Bears:</strong> Be alert for bears at all times. Always maintain a minimum distance of 50 yards from any bears, even if the electric fence is between you and the bear. The electric fence is bear-resistant, not bear-proof. If a bear enters the campground, open all of the fence gates–if it is safe to do so–and notify a park employee.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Check-in and Check-out:</strong> Check-in to the campground at the Brooks Camp Visitor Center when you arrive. Checkout time is 12 noon.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Cooking Shelters:</strong> Use the cooking shelters to prepare and eat your food. This concentrates food odors away from tents. Do not use the shelters for drying or storing gear or sleeping.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fires:</strong> Fires are only permitted in the fire rings next to each cooking shelter. Only dead and down wood can be collected to burn. Do not burn or dispose of food in the fire rings. Minimize food odors by cooking food over a stove in the cooking shelters.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Food:</strong> All campers are required to store all food and odorous items inside of the designated food cache when those items are not immediately needed. No cooking or eating is allowed outside of the designated cooking shelters. Dishes must be washed at the water spigot adjacent to the food cache. Dishes and utensils should be scraped clean before washing at the spigot.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Fuel Storage</strong>: Petroleum products attract bears. Therefore, store all stoves and fuel in the lockers adjacent to the gear cache. Separate liquid from gaseous fuels and place each in the appropriate locker.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Garbage:</strong> Dispose of all trash and leftover food in the trash cans located in the food cache. Separate burnable items such as paper and food from non-burnable items like glass and metal. All potentially hazardous items should be placed in the hazmat container.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Gear and Equipment:</strong> Use the designated gear cache for storing extra equipment. This helps to make the campground less attractive to curious bears, and properly stored gear is less likely to be damaged if a bear does enter the campground.</p></li>\\n\\t<li><p><strong>Limitations and Group size:</strong> Campers are limited to seven nights in July and 14 nights per calendar year.
