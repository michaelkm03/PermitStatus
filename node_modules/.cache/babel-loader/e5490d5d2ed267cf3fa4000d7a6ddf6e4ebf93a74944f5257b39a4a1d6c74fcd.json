For most, it is an exciting, arduous hike; for a few, it becomes more adventure than they bargained for. Every summer, park rangers must assist hundreds of people on the Half Dome trail.</p>\\n\\t<p>The most famous—or infamous—part of the hike is the ascent up the cables. The two metal cables allow hikers to climb the last 400 feet to the summit without rock climbing equipment. Since 1919, only a few people have fallen and died on the cables. However, injuries are not uncommon for those acting irresponsibly.</p>\\n\\t<p>The cables are not the only difficult part of the hike, which is 14 to 16 miles round-trip and gains 4,800 feet. If you're planning to hike Half Dome, you should be in good physical condition. However, the reward is worth the effort! Along the way, you'll encounter outstanding views of Vernal and Nevada Falls, Liberty Cap, Half Dome, and—from the subdome and summit—panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra.</p>\\n\\t<p>It takes most people 10 to 12 hours to hike to Half Dome and back. If you plan on hiking during the day, it's smart to leave before or at sunrise. You should have a non-negotiable turn-around time (i.e., if you're not at the summit by a certain time, you'll turn around). Check sunrise and sunset times before you embark on your hike, and always bring a flashlight or headlamp with fresh batteries for each person. Although the trail is well marked, you should be prepared with a good topographic map and compass, and knowledge of how to use them.</p>\\n\\t<p>Much of the hike to Half Dome is an unpredictable adventure into Wilderness, but preparation is paramount.</p>\",\n  \"city\": \"Yosemite\",\n  \"state\": \"CA\",\n  \"lotteries\": [{\n    \"executed\": true,\n    \"id\":

Float through steep walls of basalt cliffs to enjoy world-class fishing, exciting whitewater and beautiful scenery on this spectacular river. Every day offers opportunities to experience a diverse community of fish, wildlife, vegetation, and the incredible geologic and cultural history of the region.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Deschutes River begins high in the Cascade Mountains and travels 252-miles north to the Columbia River. The last 100 miles of the river’s path are known as the Lower Deschutes River, which is designated as both a Federal Wild and Scenic River and an Oregon Scenic Waterway.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes has a unique flow that is fairly uniform compared to other similar rivers. The annual fluctuation between flows is small due to the many springs that feed the river in the upper reaches, and the effects of the Pelton Reregulation Dam, which delivers a uniform flow for the last 100 miles.</p>\\n\\t<p>Whitewater rafting, kayaking, drift and jetboating are all available on the Lower Deschutes River. For thrilling whitewater, the most popular section is the 10 mile day-float from Harpham Flat to Sandy Beach, with rapids rated up to Class III+. Anglers from all over the world are drawn to the river for the abundant trout and steelhead fishing. The river also offers opportunities for overnight boating trips, drive-in camping, hiking, mountain biking and hunting.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes uses a Boater Pass system to protect it from excessive human impacts. Boater Passes are required year-round for day and overnight use for anyone using a watercraft or floating device for transport. As part of that protection plan, we also ask you to learn and practice “Leave No Trace” ethics and leave no trace of your visit.</p>\\n\\t<p>If you plan to camp overnight in a drive-in campground, be sure to arrive early to get a campsite, as no reservations are taken and campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes has a rich cultural history, providing sustenance for thousands of years to the Warm Springs and Wasco people moving seasonally through the area. In the 1800s, due to increasing pressure from settlers, many moved to the lands now known as the Warm Springs Reservation, which borders much of the west side of the Lower Deschutes. Members of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs retain their fishing rights and can be seen dip net fishing the traditional way on platforms over the river just below Sherars Falls.</p>\\n\\t<p>The elevation drops from 1,393 feet at Pelton Dam to 160 feet at its confluence with the Columbia River. The most significant drops in gradient are Sherars Falls (River Mile 44), with a vertical drop of 15 feet, and Whitehorse Rapids (River Mile 75), with a gradient of approximately 35-40 feet over one mile.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes River is managed cooperatively by three agencies: Prineville District Bureau of Land Management; the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs; and Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.</p>\",\n  \"city\": \"Prineville\",\n  \"state\": \"OR\",\n  \"lotteries\": null,\n  \"phone\": \"541-416-6700\",\n  \"count\": 19,\n  \"img\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15dhUZfpcBnCbNoeCCuwXz85hniGddyp0\",\n  \"dt\": \"2023-02-02\"\n}, {\n  \"permit_id\": \"4675310\",\n  \"name\": \"Angels Landing: Spring (Hikes on March 1 - May 31)\",\n  \"description\": \"<p>Zion National Park is piloting a permit program to hike Angels Landing. The program provides a fair process that will improve visitor experience and protect park resources along Angels Landing. Everyone who wants to hike from Scout Lookout to Angels Landing along the half-mile section of trail with chains needs to have a permit. This applies to hikers at all times of day and all times of year. Get a permit by applying to a Seasonal Lottery or by applying for our Day-before Lottery. Hikes during the spring, March 1 to May 31, 2023 can be found on this page. See ‘Additional Information’ on the right hand side of this website for other seasons with active lotteries. Hiking on the West Rim Trail to Scout Lookout does not require a permit.    </p>\\n<p>A permit is an opportunity, not a guarantee that conditions will allow a hike on your date and time. Environmental or trail conditions may result in the NPS closing the trail and you may not be able to do the hike. If parking is full you may need to park at a nearby trailhead, or return later when parking is available. Zion Canyon Scenic Drive may close due to parking availability. During most of the year, private vehicles are not allowed on the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, and the park shuttle provides access to the trailhead. Check park website for shuttle dates. </p>\\n<p>When you apply for the lottery, you can pick up to 7 days and times or ranges of days and times that you are available to hike. Be sure to list the dates you want most first. The lottery uses a ranked choice system to allocate permits. If you do not get your first choice, you may get another.  </p>\\n<p>You can list up to six people (including the applicant) on your lottery application.    </p>\\n<p>Applicants pay a $6 non-refundable application fee. This pays for recreation.gov to manage applications, run the lottery, and send emails to every applicant. You will automatically pay a $3 per person fee if recreation.gov issues a permit. This pays for National Park Service rangers to provide help on the trail and check permits.   </p>\\n<p>If you get a permit, you need to print or download it to bring on your hike. Cellular and data connectivity in the park are poor, so do this before you get to Zion. You may be asked to show your permit and valid photo identification to rangers at any point along the trail. </p>\\n<p>Throughout the pilot, the effectiveness of the program will be monitored and adjustments may be made. As the first year of implementation closes, initial results of the pilot and major adjustments for future hikes will be shared.

The creek flows from its source at Fossil Springs 14 miles to its confluence with the Verde River, downstream of the historic and decommissioned Childs Power Plant.  Fossil Creek is one of only two Wild and Scenic Rivers in Arizona.  At temperatures of 70 degrees Fahrenheit, water gushes out at 20,000 gallons per minute from springs at the bottom of a 1,600-foot deep canyon.  Over the years these calcium-rich waters have laid down huge deposits of a material called travertine. That rock-like substance encases whatever happens to fall into the streambed - forming the fossil-like formations for which the area is named.</p>\\n<p>Fossil Creek has several Western Apache and Yavapai cultural sites. The Western Apache and Yavapai peoples lived along Fossil Creek for generations and still consider this to be part of their homeland and of great cultural importance.</p>\\n<p>Because of its beauty and year-round water, people are drawn to this area.  The lushness of the riparian area strikes a sharp contrast to the dry and sparse desert vegetation that surrounds it.  Fossil Creek recreation sites can be accessed in two ways. The first is by taking State Route 260 near Camp Verde to Forest Road 708 and driving the 14 miles of rough dirt road to designated parking lots and creek access sites near Fossil Creek.  The second is via a strenuous hike four miles one way and 1,500 feet of elevation down to the headwaters of Fossil Creek from the Bob Bear Trailhead parking lot outside of the town of Strawberry.

Thirty-one miles of the river were protected as a Federal Wild and Scenic River in 1988. The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) primary objective is to ensure that wilderness resources and experience are protected.</p>\\n<p>The 22 miles of the river from Cooper’s El Vado Ranch to Chavez Canyon flows through a BLM Wilderness Study Area and the designated Chama Canyons Wilderness Area.

Sunday through Thursday launches are termed <strong>'Weekday'</strong>. Water is released from El Vado Reservoir between 10:00 am and Noon on Friday and reduced between 10:00 am and Noon on Sunday.  The water takes about 12 hours to either reach, or recede at, Chavez Canyon access site.</p>\\n<p>Downstream from the Chavez Canyon access, nine miles of additional class II-III rapids flows along Forest Road 151 to Big Eddy access.

The facility is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and is a popular cabin used by winter recreationists. Peak season for use of the cabin is usually November through June. It provides access to scenic terrain, specifically hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing activities. During the summer months (usually July-September) the A-Frame is easily accessed by taking a short quarter mile walk through the Tilly Jane Campground. During the winter months (October-June), it serves as a winter retreat for persons hardy enough to make the effort to get to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park. Winter conditions often exist for nine months of the year. Visitors can ski to the cabin following a nine mile gently sloping road or climb the historic Tilly Jane ski trail which is roughly 2.7 miles, with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet. Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended! Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety. Backcountry travel experience is highly recommended. </p>\\n<p>The 24-by-48, two story structure has a sleeping loft, accessed by a ladder that can accommodate up to 20 people. More than one group may reserve the facility at the same time. The cabin is equipped with two picnic tables, benches, chairs, a wood stove for heating and boiling/melting snow. In warmer months, water can be found with a short walk to Tilly Jane Creek. We advise that all water be treated or boiled. In winter, water can be obtained by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek or by melting snow using the pots provided at the cabin. A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided within the alcove of the structure. You will need to bring your own toilet paper. Guests will also need to provide sleeping bags and pads, warm clothing, headlamps, cooking pots/pans, stove and fuel, matches or a lighter. It is best to treat your stay as a backpacking trip, bringing everything you need minus a tent. Several lanterns and replacement mantels are available. You will need to provide the one pound green propane canisters if you wish to use the lanterns. Firewood and splitting tools are provided. </p>\\n<p>The A-Frame is located high on the north side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet.

The facility is surrounded by old growth trees and is roughly 1,000 feet below tree line. </p>\\n<p>Multiple trails can be accessed from the A-Frame, some of which are well marked and others covered by snow for most of the year. Nearby trails offer a variety of day trips, including to the Cooper Spur Stone shelter which offers great views of the majestic Mt.

There are currently three distinct types of campsites within the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness or other areas managed as Wilderness— chickees, ground sites, and beach sites.  </p>\\n<p><strong>Chickee Sites </strong></p>\\n<p>Chickee sites are located along waterways and bays where dry land is inaccessible for camping. Comprised of elevated wooden platforms with roofs, chickees give campers a unique experience of camping above the water's surface. Chickee platforms are 10 ft by 12 ft and are built to hold a maximum of 6 people or 1 group per platform. All of a group's tents must fit on one reserved platform. A portable toilet is provided at each chickee. Campfires are not allowed. There are 17 chickee sites in Everglades National Park, twelve of which are double-chickees.  </p>\\n<p><strong>Ground Sites </strong></p>\\n<p>Ground sites are located along interior bays and rivers, typically on mounds of earth a few feet above the surrounding mangroves. Ground sites can accommodate larger groups and can hold multiple parties. Campfires, as well as wood, charcoal, and coal-fueled grills and stoves are not permitted, so the use of gas grills or gas stoves is required. There are 13 ground sites in Everglades National Park.  </p>\\n<p><strong>Beach Sites </strong></p>\\n<p>Beach sites are located on the coast and provide opportunities for camping on the sand along the shoreline. Coastal breeze during ideal conditions makes insects scarce at times. Beach sites are the only type of campsite in Wilderness where campfires are allowed, but fires must be built below storm surge line. There are 15 beach sites in Everglades National Park.   </p>\\n<p>Any wilderness camping outside of designated campsite types listed above (ex: Shark River Slough) requires a Special Use Permit from the Chief Ranger’s Office. </p>\\n<p>A permit is not required for nights camping/sleeping aboard boats that are anchored out of sight of chickees and 1/4 mile from occupied beach or ground sites.</p>\\n<p>Groups over 6 people may call the Gulf Coast or Flamingo Visitor Centers with questions regarding accommodating large group reservations.</p>\",\n  \"city\": \"Homestead\",\n  \"state\": \"FL\",\n  \"lotteries\": null,\n  \"phone\": \"(239) 695-2945 Guy Bradley Visitor Center/Flamingo; (239) 695-4758 Gulf Coast\",\n  \"count\": 18,\n  \"img\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15dhUZfpcBnCbNoeCCuwXz85hniGddyp0\",\n  \"dt\": \"2023-02-02\"\n}, {\n  \"permit_id\": \"4675321\",\n  \"name\": \"Glacier National Park Wilderness Permits\",\n  \"description\": \"<p>With its towering mountains, pristine alpine lakes, abundant wildlife, over 700 miles of trails, and 65 wilderness campgrounds, Glacier is a backpacking paradise. <strong>A permit is required for backpacking in the park.

East of the divide, trails start at around 5,000 feet and the terrain is more sparsely vegetated, creating more open vistas. </p>\\n<p>Glacier was recommended for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1974. National Park Service policy requires that the park’s character not be degraded and remain unimpaired for future use and enjoyment. Recommended wilderness lands are managed differently than front-country or backcountry areas, with minimal human manipulation of a diverse, intact, natural ecosystem. Remaining undeveloped, with minimal mechanization and modern influence, wilderness lands provide outstanding opportunities for solitude and primitive, unconfined recreation.

As a result of that act and subsequent legislation, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks currently protect more than 1,300 square miles of designated and recommended wilderness, or approximately 97% of the parks.</p>\\n<p>The parks overlie an extraordinary continuum of ecosystems arrayed along the greatest vertical relief (1,370 to 14,505 feet in elevation) of any protected area in the lower 48 states. Magnificent glacial canyons, broad lake basins, lush meadows, and sheer granite peaks--hallmarks of the most rugged portion of the High Sierra--form the core of the largest expanse of contiguous wilderness in California. These are the ancestral lands of the Mono/Monache, Paiute, Tübatulabal, and Yokuts; a unique place valued and visited by people from around the world.</p>\\n<p>Well-known destinations such as Mount Whitney and popular itineraries such as the John Muir Trail, Pacific Crest Trail, High Sierra Trail, and Rae Lakes Loop are heavily traveled and there is high demand for limited entry. The relatively accessible lake basins near Lodgepole and Mineral King are busy on weekends but can be quiet mid-week. Lesser-known destinations such as the Monarch Divide, Roaring River country, eastern slopes of the Great Western Divide, and the Hockett Plateau can offer outstanding opportunities for solitude throughout the year.</p>\\n<p>The popularity of these mountains mean that every visitor must minimize their impacts to the land and its community of life. Small actions repeated thousands of times have the potential to degrade the wilderness for current and future generations. Take the time to learn how you can protect this place by reading and understanding the <a href=\\\"https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/backpacking.htm\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow\\\">requirements to minimize your impacts</a>  while visiting.</p>\",\n  \"city\": \"Three Rivers\",\n  \"state\": \"CA\",\n  \"lotteries\": null,\n  \"phone\": \"559-565-3766\",\n  \"count\": 0,\n  \"img\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15dhUZfpcBnCbNoeCCuwXz85hniGddyp0\",\n  \"dt\": \"2023-02-02\"\n}, {\n  \"permit_id\": \"234625\",\n  \"name\": \"Hells Canyon - Snake River (4 Rivers)\",\n  \"description\": \"<p><strong>The mighty Snake River winds its way through Hells Canyon</strong>, the deepest river-carved gorge in North America.

The native Tlingit people called this place \\\"Kootznoowoo\\\" meaning \\\"fortress of the bears.\\\" Containing over a million acres, its gentle mountain slopes and steady precipitation create a lush temperate rain forest and ubiquitous salmon spawning habitat which makes it an ideal home for the Alaskan brown bear. The island boasts one of the healthiest bear populations in the world with approximately one bear per square mile and is home to around 1,500 bears. These coastal brown bears are akin to \\\"grizzlies\\\" of the interior and easily distinguished by a large hump of muscle over their shoulders, as well as a dish-shaped face. </p>\\n<p><strong>The Nature of Pack Creek</strong> </p>\\n<p>From its headwaters 4000 feet above sea level, Pack Creek descends rapidly to the ocean salt water in upper Seymour Canal. Sediments are deposited at its mouth, creating a 400-acre estuary. These mudflats are an important source of food for many animals, including bears, which feed on clams, shellfish and other creatures throughout the summer. </p>\\n<p>Bears gather here when the pink and chum salmon return to spawn in their natal stream.  Like all things wild, it is not possible to know exactly when the salmon runs begin in Pack Creek as it is part of an intricate and dynamic system.  In the last several years bears begin catching fish between the second and last week of July.  </p>\\n<p>The Pack Creek ecosystem is home to more than just brown bears.  The wilderness world of Pack Creek contains endless opportunities for inspiration and discovery.  Admiralty Island contains the highest concentration of bald eagle nests in the world. Other birds, mammals and marine life thrive in this rich ecosystem of old growth rain forest and coastal marine environments. </p>\\n<p><strong>Recreation</strong></p>\\n<p>The Pack Creek Bear Viewing Area is within a federally designated Wilderness Area. This means there is limited development on site.  There is no dock or restrooms. You can choose to walk the beach to the viewing spit or hike about one mile to an observation tower and spend time enjoying the wilderness. </p>\\n<p><strong>No humans or bears have ever been harmed at Pack Creek.</strong> In order to maintain this record and perpetuate quality bear viewing opportunities, all visitors must strictly follow Pack Creek protocols. These behavior protocols perpetuate patterns that maintain a safe and stress free environment for the bears who make Pack Creek their home, and creates the unique opportunity for  visitors to witness bears in their natural environment, unbothered by human presence.</p>\",\n  \"city\": \"Juneau\",\n  \"state\": \"AK\",\n  \"lotteries\": null,\n  \"phone\": \"907-586-8800\",\n  \"count\": 25,\n  \"img\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15dhUZfpcBnCbNoeCCuwXz85hniGddyp0\",\n  \"dt\": \"2023-02-02\"\n}, {\n  \"permit_id\": \"251349\",\n  \"name\": \"Anan Wildlife Observatory Permits\",\n  \"description\": \"<p>Anan is a world-class wildlife viewing area and one of the few places in the world where both black and brown bear feed at the same creek at the same time.

The Stikine Tlingit clans had summer fish camps here and used Anan Creek’s large salmon spawning run to catch and preserve salmon for their winter food supply. Anan was unique because the large amount of salmon available made it possible to have several clans sharing one fish camp. </p>\\n<p>The abundance of salmon also drew non-native people to Anan Creek. In 1901, Pilot Fish Packing Company set up a large fish trap at the mouth of Anan that allowed few fish to make it up the creek. This lack of escapement was very destructive to the Anan salmon population. Commercial fish traps were outlawed shortly after Alaska became a state in 1959. </p>\\n<p><strong>Location and Environment:</strong> </p>\\n<p>The Anan Wildlife Observatory is located on the mainland within Alaska's Tongass National Forest roughly 35 miles south of the town of Wrangell.

The conical snow covered mountain was often referred to as the Mount Fuji of America. The May 18, 1980 eruption transformed the mountain and surrounding landscape significantly. The volcano lost an estimated 3.4 billion cubic yards (0.63 cubic mile) of its cone (about 1,300 feet or 396 meters in height), leaving behind a horseshoe-shaped crater (open to the north), with the highest part of the crater rim on the southwestern side at 8,365 feet (2,550 meters) elevation. Today the summit of Mount St. Helens offers climbers a breathtaking view of neighboring cascade peaks, the crater formed by the 1980 eruption and surrounding areas. </p>\\n<p>Mount St. Helens is a popular climb for both beginner and experienced mountaineers.

The left bank of the river from Montezuma Creek to Trimble Camp is managed by the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Nation requires additional permits to camp, hike, or visit archaeological sites on river left. For more information on how to obtain a Navajo permit, call the Navajo Parks and Recreation Office at (928) 871-6647.</p>\\n\\t<p>There are three major access points for the San Juan River. Most trips launch at either Sand Island or Mexican Hat and take out at Mexican Hat or Clay Hills. Sand Island to Mexican Hat is about 27 miles and most boaters take two to three days to float this segment. Mexican Hat to Clay Hills is approximately 57 miles and is typically a four to five day trip. Sand Island to Clay Hills is about 84 miles and is typically a six to seven day trip. Clay Hills is the only viable take-out below Mexican Hat. There is a dangerous waterfall downstream from Clay Hills. The seldom-floated Montezuma Creek to Sand Island segment is approximately 17 miles.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Navajo Dam in New Mexico controls San Juan flows. There is usually adequate river flow for boating all year. However, larger and heavier boats may have trouble navigating through rapids below Mexican Hat and dispersed mud bars from Slickhorn Canyon to Clay Hills at lower water levels. The months of May and June are the most popular time to float the river due to higher river flows. Upstream flash floods can cause river levels to rise rapidly.

Along the way, you'll encounter outstanding views of Vernal and Nevada Falls, Liberty Cap, Half Dome, and—from the subdome and summit—panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra.</p>\\n\\t<p>It takes most people 10 to 12 hours to hike to Half Dome and back. If you plan on hiking during the day, it's smart to leave before or at sunrise.

Check sunrise and sunset times before you embark on your hike, and always bring a flashlight or headlamp with fresh batteries for each person. Although the trail is well marked, you should be prepared with a good topographic map and compass, and knowledge of how to use them.</p>\\n\\t<p>Much of the hike to Half Dome is an unpredictable

Float through steep walls of basalt cliffs to enjoy world-class fishing, exciting whitewater and beautiful scenery on this spectacular river. Every day offers opportunities to experience a diverse community of fish, wildlife, vegetation, and the incredible geologic and cultural history of the region.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Deschutes River begins high in the Cascade Mountains and travels 252-miles north to the Columbia River. The last 100 miles of the river’s path are known as the Lower Deschutes River, which is designated as both a Federal Wild and Scenic River and an Oregon Scenic Waterway.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes has a unique flow that is fairly uniform compared to other similar rivers. The annual fluctuation between flows is small due to the many springs that feed the river in the upper reaches, and the effects of the Pelton Reregulation Dam, which delivers a uniform flow for the last 100 miles.</p>\\n\\t<p>Whitewater rafting, kayaking, drift and jetboating are all available on the Lower Deschutes River. For thrilling whitewater, the most popular section is the 10 mile day-float from Harpham Flat to Sandy Beach, with rapids rated up to Class III+. Anglers from all over the world are drawn to the river for the abundant trout and steelhead fishing. The river also offers opportunities for overnight boating trips, drive-in camping, hiking, mountain biking and hunting.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes uses a Boater Pass system to protect it from excessive human impacts. Boater Passes are required year-round for day and overnight use for anyone using a watercraft or floating device for transport. As part of that protection plan, we also ask you to learn and practice “Leave No Trace” ethics and leave no trace of your visit.</p>\\n\\t<p>If you plan to camp overnight in a drive-in campground, be sure to arrive early to get a campsite, as no reservations are taken and campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes has a rich cultural history, providing sustenance for thousands of years to the Warm Springs and Wasco people moving seasonally through the area. In the 1800s, due to increasing pressure from settlers, many moved to the lands now known as the Warm Springs Reservation, which borders much of the west side of the Lower Deschutes. Members of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs retain their fishing rights and can be seen dip net fishing the traditional way on platforms over the river just below Sherars Falls.</p>\\n\\t<p>The elevation drops from 1,393 feet at Pelton Dam to 160 feet at its confluence with the Columbia River. The most significant drops in gradient are Sherars Falls (River Mile 44), with a vertical drop of 15 feet, and Whitehorse Rapids (River Mile 75), with a gradient of approximately 35-40 feet over one mile.</p>\\n\\t<p>The Lower Deschutes River is managed cooperatively by three agencies: Prineville District Bureau of Land Management; the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs; and Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.</p>\",\n        \"city\": \"Prineville\",\n        \"state\": \"OR\",\n        \"lotteries\": null,\n        \"phone\": \"541-416-6700\",\n        \"count\": 19,\n        \"img\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15dhUZfpcBnCbNoeCCuwXz85hniGddyp0\",\n        \"dt\": \"2023-02-02\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"permit_id\": \"4675310\",\n        \"name\": \"Angels Landing: Spring (Hikes on March 1 - May 31)\",\n        \"description\": \"<p>Zion National Park is piloting a permit program to hike Angels Landing.

Everyone who wants to hike from Scout Lookout to Angels Landing along the half-mile section of trail with chains needs to have a permit. This applies to hikers at all times of day and all times of year. Get a permit by applying to a Seasonal Lottery or by applying for our Day-before Lottery. Hikes during the spring, March 1 to May 31, 2023 can be found on this page. See ‘Additional Information’ on the right hand side of this website for other seasons with active lotteries. Hiking on the West Rim Trail to Scout Lookout does not require a permit.    </p>\\n<p>A permit is an opportunity, not a guarantee that conditions will allow a hike on your date and time. Environmental or trail conditions may result in the NPS closing the trail and you may not be able to do the hike. If parking is full you may need to park at a nearby trailhead, or return later when parking is available. Zion Canyon Scenic Drive may close due to parking availability. During most of the year, private vehicles are not allowed on the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, and the park shuttle provides access to the trailhead. Check park website for shuttle dates. </p>\\n<p>When you apply for the lottery, you can pick up to 7 days and times or ranges of days and times that you are available to hike. Be sure to list the dates you want most first. The lottery uses a ranked choice system to allocate permits. If you do not get your first choice, you may get another.  </p>\\n<p>You can list up to six people (including the applicant) on your lottery application.    </p>\\n<p>Applicants pay a $6 non-refundable application fee. This pays for recreation.gov to manage applications, run the lottery, and send emails to every applicant. You will automatically pay a $3 per person fee if recreation.gov issues a permit. This pays for National Park Service rangers to provide help on the trail and check permits.   </p>\\n<p>If you get a permit, you need to print or download it to bring on your hike. Cellular and data connectivity in the park are poor, so do this before you get to Zion. You may be asked to show your permit and valid photo identification to rangers at any point along the trail. </p>\\n<p>Throughout the pilot, the effectiveness of the program will be monitored and adjustments may be made. As the first year of implementation closes, initial results of the pilot and major adjustments for future hikes will be shared.

Fossil Creek is one of only two Wild and Scenic Rivers in Arizona.  At temperatures of 70 degrees Fahrenheit, water gushes out at 20,000 gallons per minute from springs at the bottom of a 1,600-foot deep canyon.  Over the years these calcium-rich waters have laid down huge deposits of a material called travertine. That rock-like substance encases whatever happens to fall into the streambed - forming the fossil-like formations for which the area is named.</p>\\n<p>Fossil Creek has several Western Apache and Yavapai cultural sites. The Western Apache and Yavapai peoples lived along Fossil Creek for generations and still consider this to be part of their homeland and of great cultural importance.</p>\\n<p>Because of its beauty and year-round water, people are drawn to this area.  The lushness of the riparian area strikes a sharp contrast to the dry and sparse desert vegetation that surrounds it.  Fossil Creek recreation sites can be accessed in two ways. The first is by taking State Route 260 near Camp Verde to Forest Road 708 and driving the 14 miles of rough dirt road to designated parking lots and creek access sites near Fossil Creek.  The second is via a strenuous hike four miles one way and 1,500 feet of elevation down to the headwaters of Fossil Creek from the Bob Bear Trailhead parking lot outside of the town of Strawberry.

Thirty-one miles of the river were protected as a Federal Wild and Scenic River in 1988.

It provides access to scenic terrain, specifically hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing activities. During the summer months (usually July-September) the A-Frame is easily accessed by taking a short quarter mile walk through the Tilly Jane Campground. During the winter months (October-June), it serves as a winter retreat for persons hardy enough to make the effort to get to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park. Winter conditions often exist for nine months of the year. Visitors can ski to the cabin following a nine mile gently sloping road or climb the historic Tilly Jane ski trail which is roughly 2.7 miles, with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet. Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended! Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety. Backcountry travel experience is highly recommended. </p>\\n<p>The 24-by-48, two story structure has a sleeping loft, accessed by a ladder that can accommodate up to 20 people. More than one group may reserve the facility at the same time. The cabin is equipped with two picnic tables, benches, chairs, a wood stove for heating and boiling/melting snow. In warmer months, water can be found with a short walk to Tilly Jane Creek. We advise that all water be treated or boiled. In winter, water can be obtained by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek or by melting snow using the pots provided at the cabin. A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided within the alcove of the structure. You will need to bring your own toilet paper. Guests will also need to provide sleeping bags and pads, warm clothing, headlamps, cooking pots/pans, stove and fuel, matches or a lighter. It is best to treat your stay as a backpacking trip, bringing everything you need minus a tent. Several lanterns and replacement mantels are available. You will need to provide the one pound green propane canisters if you wish to use the lanterns. Firewood and splitting tools are provided. </p>\\n<p>The A-Frame is located high on the north side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet. It is one of five structures within the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District.

The facility is surrounded by old growth trees and is roughly 1,000 feet below tree line. </p>\\n<p>Multiple trails can be accessed from the A-Frame, some of which are well marked and others covered by snow for most of the year. Nearby trails offer a variety of day trips, including to the Cooper Spur Stone shelter which offers great views of the majestic Mt.

Everglades National Park protects an unparalleled landscape that provides important habitat for numerous rare and endangered species like the manatee, American crocodile, and the elusive Florida panther.</p>\\n<p>Everglades National Park designates campsites to prevent resource damage and to improve visitor experience by focusing camping impacts on resilient sites. There are currently three distinct types of campsites within the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness or other areas managed as Wilderness— chickees, ground sites, and beach sites.  </p>\\n<p><strong>Chickee Sites </strong></p>\\n<p>Chickee sites are located along waterways and bays where dry land is inaccessible for camping. Comprised of elevated wooden platforms with roofs, chickees give campers a unique experience of camping above the water's surface. Chickee platforms are 10 ft by 12 ft and are built to hold a maximum of 6 people or 1 group per platform. All of a group's tents must fit on one reserved platform. A portable toilet is provided at each chickee. Campfires are not allowed. There are 17 chickee sites in Everglades National Park, twelve of which are double-chickees.  </p>\\n<p><strong>Ground Sites </strong></p>\\n<p>Ground sites are located along interior bays and rivers, typically on mounds of earth a few feet above the surrounding mangroves. Ground sites can accommodate larger groups and can hold multiple parties. Campfires, as well as wood, charcoal, and coal-fueled grills and stoves are not permitted, so the use of gas grills or gas stoves is required. There are 13 ground sites in Everglades National Park.  </p>\\n<p><strong>Beach Sites </strong></p>\\n<p>Beach sites are located on the coast and provide opportunities for camping on the sand along the shoreline. Coastal breeze during ideal conditions makes insects scarce at times. Beach sites are the only type of campsite in Wilderness where campfires are allowed, but fires must be built below storm surge line. There are 15 beach sites in Everglades National Park.   </p>\\n<p>Any wilderness camping outside of designated campsite types listed above (ex: Shark River Slough) requires a Special Use Permit from the Chief Ranger’s Office. </p>\\n<p>A permit is not required for nights camping/sleeping aboard boats that are anchored out of sight of chickees and 1/4 mile from occupied beach or ground sites.</p>\\n<p>Groups over 6 people may call the Gulf Coast or Flamingo Visitor Centers with questions regarding accommodating large group reservations.</p>\",\n        \"city\": \"Homestead\",\n        \"state\": \"FL\",\n        \"lotteries\": null,\n        \"phone\": \"(239) 695-2945 Guy Bradley Visitor Center/Flamingo; (239) 695-4758 Gulf Coast\",\n        \"count\": 18,\n        \"img\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15dhUZfpcBnCbNoeCCuwXz85hniGddyp0\",\n        \"dt\": \"2023-02-02\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"permit_id\": \"4675321\",\n        \"name\": \"Glacier National Park Wilderness Permits\",\n        \"description\": \"<p>With its towering mountains, pristine alpine lakes, abundant wildlife, over 700 miles of trails, and 65 wilderness campgrounds, Glacier is a backpacking paradise. <strong>A permit is required for backpacking in the park.

Each trail on a respective side offers a similar \\\"feel.\\\" West side trails start at around 3,200 feet in elevation, are more heavily forested, and offer the greatest solitude. East of the divide, trails start at around 5,000 feet and the terrain is more sparsely vegetated, creating more open vistas. </p>\\n<p>Glacier was recommended for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1974. National Park Service policy requires that the park’s character not be degraded and remain unimpaired for future use and enjoyment. Recommended wilderness lands are managed differently than front-country or backcountry areas, with minimal human manipulation of a diverse, intact, natural ecosystem. Remaining undeveloped, with minimal mechanization and modern influence, wilderness lands provide outstanding opportunities for solitude and primitive, unconfined recreation. As such, Glacier National Park is managed in a way to preserve its wilderness character for future generations.</p>\",\n        \"city\": \"West Glacier\",\n        \"state\": \"Montana\",\n        \"lotteries\": null,\n        \"phone\": \"406-888-7800\",\n        \"count\": 1,\n        \"img\": \"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15dhUZfpcBnCbNoeCCuwXz85hniGddyp0\",\n        \"dt\": \"2023-02-02\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"permit_id\": \"4251904\",\n        \"name\": \"Canyonlands National Park Day Use Backcountry Permits\",\n        \"description\": \"<p>Canyonlands National Park is a wilderness of countless canyons and fantastically formed buttes carved by the Colorado River and its tributaries.

The Stikine Tlingit clans had summer fish camps here and used Anan Creek’s large salmon spawning run to catch and preserve salmon for their winter food supply. Anan was unique because the large amount of salmon available made it possible to have several clans sharing one fish camp. </p>\\n<p>The abundance of salmon also drew non-native people to Anan Creek. In 1901, Pilot Fish Packing Company set up a large fish trap at the mouth of Anan that allowed few fish to make it up the creek.
